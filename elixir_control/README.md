# ElixirControl

ElixirControl is the control center for the Caracara project, a Kafka-like messaging service. It provides a web interface to monitor and manage Caracara.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Elixir and Erlang:** This project requires Elixir `~> 1.14`. You can follow the instructions on the official [Elixir installation page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) to install both Elixir and Erlang. `mix`, the Elixir build tool, is included with the Elixir installation.

## Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

1.  **Install dependencies and set up the project:**
    ```bash
    mix setup
    ```
    This will fetch all Elixir dependencies, and install and build the necessary assets.

2.  **Start the Phoenix server:**
    ```bash
    mix phx.server
    ```
    You can also run it inside an IEx session:
    ```bash
    iex -S mix phx.server
    ```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
